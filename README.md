# AmericanPresidentSpeechAnalysis-NLP

#Summary
Natural Language Processing Techniques are used to analyze American president speeches. Sentiment analysis has evolved over past few decades, most of the work in it revolved around textual sentiment analysis with text mining techniques. However, audio sentiment analysis is still in a coming to existence stage in the exploration network groups. In this proposed paper, we perform sentiment analysis on president speeches on State Union addresses from the year 1970-2019 using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect the impact of speech on public as positive or negative sentiment. We analyzed different speeches and tried different classification techniques to predict accuracy.
